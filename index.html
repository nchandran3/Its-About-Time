						Barcelona is the city that never sleeps - from its restaurants and cervecerías, to its nocturnal teen scene and lively beach clubs, the city promises discovery at any time of the day. A visitor's impression of an area is usually shaped by what they see first at that location. But what happens when they leave and the Sun goes down? Surely the areas are not frozen in time, the same events occurring throughout the entirety of the day. What happens when the children are in school, when the wives are left alone in their homes and the husbands are in transit? What happens when they are all together again? How can an area have different meanings when it was constructed with a singular purpose? These questions normally occur to us, but they are whisked away by the thoughts of what to do next, and where to go, and who to meet, and when to arrive, and planning for the future. We never really sit down and connect the dots - these inkblots that bleed through the paper of time to create an image far more profound than just scribbles on the surface. To truly understand an area, a culture, or even an entire city, we must break free from the rip current of obligation and itinerary to truly synthesize and understand the world around us - and the aberrations that make each location unique.

						This exhibit strives to do just that. Locations were picked to facilitate reflection; these samples are not just central hubs, but neighborhoods and plazas. Together, they characterize some of the most frequently populated spots in Barcelona - by tourist and resident alike. They epitomize the city with their allure for congregation of various races, genders, occupations, and cultures. If their walls could talk, they would recount the echoes of millions of footsteps reverberating off their sturdy bodies - each one unique, but together forming a cohesive entity.

						The pictures you are about to see have been shot over the entire day and compiled together to show the dynamism (or stagnation) of each location. Analysis was performed on not only the composition of the area, but the people and objects that make them up as well.  This exhibition affords you an opportunity to view Barcelona's temporal metamorphosis - one of its most defining and provocative facets.
